<p>
 This is a web based application to manage VoIP systems based on Freswitch.<br>
 The lightweight backend (written in Perl) has already contained all the necessary things which it needs to work (expect SQLine, see installation guide)<br>
 This solution is mainly suitable to manage small PBX systems with few domains and about 1k users.
